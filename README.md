# Personal Bill
A personal project that I build for control some bilings and financings, besides increase my ability with the topics described bellow.

## The main objectives for this projects are:
- Build an API with NodeJS and Typescript;
- Usage of the SOLID principles;
- Implement the Clean Architecture;
- TDD;
- Unit and integration testing;
- Design Patterns.

## Other important information:
 - Fully build with OOP;
 - Authentication with JWT;
 - Usage of TypeORM for database operations;
 - Express to handle HTTP requests;
 - jest for unit testing;
 - supertest for integration tests
 - Some Design Patterns like Adapter, Proxy, Composite and Decorator.
 - Divided in six layers: Domain, Data, Infra, Presentation, Validation and Main (Composition root).

Initially my goal is to create a client for this API using ReactJS (I'll post the link here when it's complete), but I'm seriously thinking in a mobile client to (React Native).
